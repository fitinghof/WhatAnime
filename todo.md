 * Group stuff from the same anime?

 * Make more by artists include composer and arranger, perhaps in it's own section.

 * Make a DNS domain

 * Finish new get anime function

 * Add report button

 * Start using branches for new features and stop being an idiot

 * There might be a bug where it does not search by every available artist, example being Take me to the beach with ado and imagine dragons where both Ado and Imagine Dragons would be listed 
 as artists on spotifies side, by this logic the site should show ado's stuff as possible matches but it doesn't.
 * I am almost certain there is a bug that prevents all anime entries in 'more by artists' from showing, where that bug is I am not sure.

 * Make a spotify bind a non-neccesity, in other words, add every song found from anisong to the db, even if it does not yet have a bind.

 * Scrape...
