 * Allow multiple spotify song bindings to same anime-song entry so that for example 'Here' and 'Here - New Version' both can be binded to 'The ancient magus bride'. Perhaps as a song-group or something so that other newly added anime also automatically gets included in the group

 * add scripts folder on same layer as backend and frontend to allow for easier testing and such

 * Add more anime info

 * Group stuff from the same anime?

 * Make more by artists include composer and arranger, perhaps in it's own section.
